At Duke, I spends my time in a few unique areas. I help lead the Duke Applied Machine Learning Group (DAML), a project based undergraduate tech organization focused on brining machine learning to small businesses. In addition to running DAML, I TA for CS classes and help run Duke's undergraduate Special Olympics chapter which holds annual flag football and basketball leagues with local Special Olympics athletes.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        }\n      />\n      <ContentSection\n        isMobile={isMobile}\n        columnOne=\n        {\n          <div className=\"about-me-content-one-wrapper\">\n            <h2 className=\"subtitle\">What am I up to?</h2>\n            <p className=\"about-me-content\">\n              A lot - This summer I've been super busy!

I've primarily worked on full stack features for end users who configure and optimize their company's search experience. At Yext, I'm treated like a full time engineer and own features through their entire lifecycle. Just two weeks ago, two new features I independently implemented were released to be used by millions of end users.\n            </p>\n            <br/>\n            <p className=\"about-me-content\">\n              In addition to working at Yext, I have been running the Phoenix Project, a program sponsered by the Duke Applied Machine Learning group which matches Duke students to technical projects and internships provided by various startups and Duke Professors. I've taken care of the whole thing, from contracts and 1099s to project matching and planning. I've also recently joined a software consulting startup called ApolloEndeavors as the Personel Director.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        }\n        columnTwo=\n        {\n          <div className=\"first-day-photo-wrapper\">\n            <img src={FirstDay} alt=\"side-pic\" />\n            <p className=\"photo-caption\">\n              Me on my first day of work at Yext!\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        }\n      />\n      <ContentSection\n        isMobile={isMobile}\n        columnOne=\n        {\n          <div className=\"wake-surf-photo-wrapper\">\n            <img src={WakeSurf} alt=\"side-pic\" />\n            <p className=\"photo-caption\">\n              Wakesurfing at camp Skylemar where I worked after my Freshman year!\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        }\n        columnTwo=\n        {\n          <div className=\"about-me-content-one-wrapper\">\n            <h2 className=\"subtitle\">What am I into ?</h2>\n              <p className=\"about-me-content\">\n                Outside of school and work, I have a number of different passions and interests in a variety of areas.
