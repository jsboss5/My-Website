# My-Website
I built this personal website utilizing reactJS, Sass Preprosessor, Javascript, and html. It's hosted at https://joshboss.me

To see the actual code, please check out the "dev" branch. The master branch is only used to store the packaged js served via github pages. I never actually edit this branch manually!
